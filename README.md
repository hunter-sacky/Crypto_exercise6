This is a basic cryptographic program which utilizes the AES cryptography algorithm. 
It takes the data from one text file and then encrypts it. 
Saving the encrypted text inside the original file and then decrypts/stores it inside of another file.

SECOND COMMIT
The CryptoTest.java program takes 2 arguments for filenames when calling it. Syntax for calling it inside of a linux terminal are as follows:
	java CryptoTest file1 file2
If the program doesn't get the required files passed to it, it will catch the errors and print out a description for the error.
I changed the text of file1 to "This is some text that will be encrypted"
I also changed the text of file2 to be blank.
